Dependencies required:
1) tweepy (for accessing twitter api and its posts)
2) textblob (your sentiment analysis module)

Extra info:
1) Create your own twitter application, and get your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret. All of these can be found at "Key and Access Tokens" section at the Application Management of your Twitter App. For more info: https://chimpgroup.com/knowledgebase/twitter-api-keys/
2) Run the application, type in the subject you are interested in, ex "dogs" , and users which tweeted about dogs would pop up and its polarity and subjectivity ratio pops out. polarity means how positive the tweet is, subjectivity how opinionated the user is.
